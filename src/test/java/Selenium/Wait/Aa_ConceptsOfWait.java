package Selenium.Wait;

/*
 * Explanation:
 * Sometimes some element takes more time than normal to load where we need to use these wait to avoid "ElementNotVisibleException"
 * 
 * Types Of Wait:
 * 1) Implicit Wait:
 * 		Implicit waits are used to provide a default waiting time (say 30 seconds)
 * 		between each consecutive test step/command across the entire test script.
 * 2) Explicit Wait (a.k.a. Dynamic Waits):
 * 		Explicit waits are used to halt the execution until the time a particular condition is met or the maximum time has elapsed.
 * 		If the timeout value is negative then the page timeout time would be infinite.		
 * 
 * 		Types of Explicit Wait:
 * 		A) WebDriver Wait
 * 		B) Fluent Wait
